## Hey, Im Franklyn/Frankie.

I am a software engineer, data scientist, and part-time geophysicist. 

My current work involves developing ETL pipelines and cloud infrastructure on AWS for [Earthscope Consortium](https://www.earthscope.org/).


I hold a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Montana, where I learned the subtle art of applying bayesian statistics and remotely sensed data to infer glacial surface velocities with Dr. Doug Brinkerhoff.
